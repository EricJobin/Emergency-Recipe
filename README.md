# Emergency Recipe

The idea for this website was to bring the user recipe ideas for whatever ingredients or dishes they entered. Once a query is entered, our site will return with the results and display them as result cards.

### Search Results:

If one of these cards is clicked on, it will show a full sized card listing the ingredients and nutritional information for the recipe, along with a link to the site where the recipe originated.

The site uses API calls to Edamam for recipe and nutritional information. The site was developed in a week using a team of four people:
