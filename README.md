This Website was created as a group project. Our idea was to bring the user recipe ideas for whatever ingredients or dishes they entered. Once a query is entered, our site will return with the results and display them as result cards. If one of these cards is clicked on, it will show a full sized card listing the ingredients and nutritional information for the recipe, along with a link to the site where the recipe originated. On the main page there are filters that can be set to return only vegetarian, vegan, peanut-free, tree-nut-free, alcohol-free recipes, or any combination thereof. There is also a link to show a map of the userâ€™s current area and nearby supermarkets.
 
The site uses APIs from Edamam and Google Maps with the places library. The site was developed in a week using a team of four people:
 
Jonas Hellstrom: https://github.com/pjhellstrom
Brian: https://github.com/Brianzzl
MJuseph: https://github.com/MJuseph
 
And Myself:
