# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  <!-- people who don't know how to cook -->
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
  <!-- it's hard to get a customized recepie -->
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  <!-- is to get healthy recepies -->
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  <!-- As a user, I want a smiple way to get a recepies i like.
       As a user, I don't want to eat junck food.
       As a user, I want to track my neutrition value.
   -->

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
